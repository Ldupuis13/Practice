If no flex-basis is specified, then the flex-basis falls back to the item’s width property.

If no width is specified, then the flex-basis falls back to the computed width of the item’s contents.

flex-basis value is limited by both the min-width and max-width

flex-basis is: the size of flex items before they are placed into a flex container. It’s the ideal or hypothetical size of the items. But flex-basis is not a guaranteed size
