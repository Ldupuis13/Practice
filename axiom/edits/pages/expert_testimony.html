      <h3>State Court</h3>
      <p class="p">Dr. Feldman has appeared in multiple state court jurisdictions. The focus of these engagements is to determine&nbsp;the fair value of the equity of a private business. In a recent testimony, Dr. Feldman demonstrated to the court, that the value of a business can be significantly reduced by a substantial unfunded pension liability, even if the liability does not appear on the balance sheet.</p>

      <h3>Tax Court</h3>
      <p class="p">During testimony, Dr. Feldman demonstrated to the court that his client’s captive insurance program was not an attempt to evade taxes, but rather, a program that insured real risks with premiums that were generally consistent with these risks. The case involved a family of companies, in construction, development, and real estate management, which were exposed to a variety of risks that were difficult to insure in the commercial market.</p>
