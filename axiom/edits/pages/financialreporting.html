Axiom Valuation provides expert and cost-effective purchase price allocations for acquisitions for compliance with ASC 805/FAS 141R. Axiom Valuation is an independent valuation expert, and our work has been reviewed and approved by all the major auditing firms.</p>

  <h3><a href="http://mikegriffin.me/axiom/what-is-airas/">Alternative Investment Returns Authentication Service (AIRAS)</a></h3><h3>
  <p align="justify">AIRAS is a statistical detective tool using Modern Portfolio Theory designed to provide a level of confidence that AI reported returns and NAVs are being reported properly. AIRAS has pioneered the use of The Replicating Portfolio (TRP) methodology to value alternative investment interests when the manager does not disclose underlying assets.
  AIRAS uses optimization and statistical methods to discover the underlying structure of an AI portfolio. Based on this, AIRAS develops a statistical-based metric, the confidence curve, which indicates the certainty that an AI fund return and NAV are reported properly.</p>
