HIDING

visuallyhidden
<label for="search" class="visuallyhidden">Search: </label>
<input type="text" name="search" id="search">
<button type="submit">Search</button>
  - hides the label

aria-label
<input type="text" name="search" aria-label="Search">
<button type="submit">Search</button>
  - supported by screen readers and other assistive technology
  - not conveyed to visual users

aria-labelledby
<input type="text" name="search" aria-labelledby="searchbutton">
<button id="searchbutton" type="submit">Search</button>
  - supported by screen readers and other assistive technology
  - not conveyed to visual users
  - * value of the "aria-labelledby" attribute is the "id" of the element containing the label text (button)*

title
<input title="Search" type="text" name="search">
<button type="submit">Search</button>
  - generally less reliable and not recommended
  - some screen readers & assistive technologies don't interpret "title" as  replacement for "label" element
  - shown to visual users as a tool tip when hovering over the form field with the mouse


  hide information visually & keep available to screen reader & assistive technology users:
  use CSS that will keep the information technically visible but practically hidden
  present "label" in a 1-by-1 pixel area w/ a 1-pixel margin,
  do not confuse with CSS visibility: hidden

  .visuallyhidden {
    border: 0;
    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
    height: 1px;
    margin: -1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    padding: 0;
    position: absolute;
    width: 1px;
  }

<button>
* <button type="submit">Submit</button> *
* <button type="button">Cancel</button> *

<input type="submit" value="Submit">
<input type="button" value="Cancel">

  "label" of "button" element is set inside & can include markup
  allows more advanced accessibility hints (like marking up language change)
  when using "input" to create buttons, label is set in "value" attribute of element
