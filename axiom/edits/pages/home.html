		<h2>Why Axiom Valuation?</h2>
			<p>Valuation needs of public and private firms, and endowment and retirement funds are complex and can be burdensome. Meeting these challenges requires valuation professionals who are academically qualified and who are accustomed to using and managing complicated valuation metrics. Our staff meets those requirements. They have undertaken extensive finance research and have published in peer-reviewed journals; but their work is grounded in real world valuation experience. Our staff members also have many years of effective interaction with auditors of the Big 4 and other firms and their valuation specialists. This combination enables Axiom to deliver an unparalleled level of service to clients.</p>
			<p>Our business model has created customer loyalty that has yielded engagements throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia. Axiom has completed thousands of valuation assignments, and we are experts when it comes to valuing business loan portfolios, common stock of privately held companies, or complicated illiquid interests in hedge funds and private equity partnerships. In the process, we have <b>saved clients millions of dollars</b>, uncovered incorrectly reported asset values, and have assissted by navigating our clients through the intricate valuation maze, which financial intermediaries, and other participants in the financial marketplace, create.</p>
